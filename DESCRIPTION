Description: 
  The disEpiODE package provides utility functions to create and discretise 
  landscapes using square, hexagonal and triangular grids, and then apply a 
  deterministic SI disease model to the grid.  The package is mostly intended 
  to support the publication "Choice of Landscape Discretisation Method Affects 
  the Inferred Rate of Spread in Wildlife Disease Spread Models" by Reimert 
  et al (in review), but may also be useful for other work.
